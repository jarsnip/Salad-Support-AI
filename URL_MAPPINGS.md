# Support URL Mappings

This document shows how local documentation files map to public support.salad.com URLs.

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your bot now automatically includes support.salad.com links in all responses!

### How It Works:
1. Bot searches local documentation for relevant answers
2. Finds the best matching articles
3. Automatically appends the public support.salad.com URL to each doc
4. AI is instructed to include these URLs in responses
5. Users get helpful answers WITH links for further reading
