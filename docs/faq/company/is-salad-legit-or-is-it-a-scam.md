title: Is Salad Legit? Or is it a Scam?
---

Salad is legit, but thanks to the actions of a few bad apples in the crypto space, people have become hesitant to trust
new ventures in the industry. Our business model puts us in a unique position, where crypto-mining made up the core of
our business in the past. It was never the source of our profit, and we have since added two non-crypto workloads for
chefs who want to share their idle computer resources. Crypto is now one of many 'jobs' your computer can perform.

Salad has no interest in selling your data, or otherwise scamming you. Our [Discord server](<https://discord.gg/salad>) is
a great place to verify our legitimacy. We also have an
excellent [TrustPilot rating](<https://www.trustpilot.com/review/salad.com>). We want to be as transparent as possible, so
the community can always keep an eye on us.
