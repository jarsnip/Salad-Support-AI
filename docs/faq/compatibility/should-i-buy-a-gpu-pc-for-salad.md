title: Should I buy a GPU/PC for Salad?
---

We're glad to hear that you're interested in helping expand the Salad network! However, we don't recommend that you buy
a GPU or PC specifically for Salad.

Due to the nature of our
[distributed and interruptible network](<https://docs.salad.com/container-engine/explanation/core-concepts/architectural-overview>),
you can't guarantee that investing into hardware will pay off. It's better to prioritize your own needs and wants before
thinking about getting components or machines "just for Salad."

If you're upgrading or getting a new PC for other reasons, like work or gaming, and want to monetize that hardware's
downtime with Salad, we do currently recommend the following minimum specifications for a PC to run Salad effectively:

- **CPU**: 4 cores or more
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 2070 or better
- **RAM**: 16 GB or more
- **Storage**: SSD with at least 100 GB free space

You can find more information about earnings for different hardware on our
[Network Monitor](<https://salad.com/earn/demand>).

## Why Shouldn't I Buy a GPU or PC for Salad?

When buying PC hardware as an investment for running workloads on Salad, you need to understand your "Return on
Investment" (ROI). On Salad, ROI would be the time it takes to earn back the money you spent on your machine, as well as
operating costs like electricity and maintenance. To calculate this, you would need to know:

- The cost of the GPU or PC.
- The earnings per hour for the hardware you plan to use.
- The number of hours you will run Salad every day.
- Your electricity rates.

Because Salad's earnings can vary day-to-day due to job availability and the needs of the network, there's no way to
guarantee a specific ROI. This means you could end up spending more on the hardware than you Chop back in Salad Balance.

## Have Other People Gotten Positive ROI on Salad PCs?

Many Chefs have paid off machines and stacked up some serious Salad Balance over the years. You may be enticed to buy a
"Salad Rig" after seeing some ludicrous earning rates or total balances on social media or in our community server, but
keep in mind a few key factors:

- Some Chefs own whole farms or data centers of GPUs.
- They likely cost optimize their rigs for power efficiency.
- They may have much lower electricity rates or operating costs.
- The hardware may be free, from work, or long ago paid for.

Unless you are in a similar camp, it's best to simply prioritize your personal interests and budget before you think
about buying something purpose-built for Salad.

## What Should I do Instead?

If you're looking to earn with Salad, we recommend continuing to use the PC you already own. There are a few things you
can do to maximize your earnings:

- Run Salad as often as possible. The longer you run it, the more likely you are to get the best jobs.
- Keep your PC well-maintained. Regular cleaning and ensuring proper cooling can help your hardware run to its full
  potential.

Ultimately, Salad is a tool to help you monetize your idle compute power. While we're working to make it as stable and
reliable as possible, for most Chefs the earnings are firmly in the "nice extra cash" camp and not the "investment
vehicle" category.
