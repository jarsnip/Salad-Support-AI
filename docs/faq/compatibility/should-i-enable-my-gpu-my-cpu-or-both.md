title: Should I enable my GPU, my CPU, or both?
---

When running Salad, you have the option to
[enable either GPU mode, CPU mode, or both](/docs/guides/using-salad/how-to-enable-and-disable-hardware). Choosing which
to run can depend the hardware on your machine, and how you wish to use Salad.

---

## GPU only:

Your Graphics Card (GPU) is usually the most powerful, and fastest, single component in your PC for running Salad on. If
you have a [compatible GPU](/docs/faq/compatibility/is-my-machine-compatible-with-salad),
[enabling](/docs/guides/using-salad/how-to-enable-and-disable-hardware) it will usually provide you with the most
earnings. We don't recommend trying to play games, or anything GPU intensive while running your GPU however, as you may
experience slowdowns, or crashes, in both Salad and your application or game. You may also experience error
notifications if other processes are competing with Salad's resource needs. When you receive on of these notifications,
Salad will block Container workloads until they are resolved.

## CPU only:

Your Central Processsing Unit (CPU) will usually be slower for Chopping with Salad than your dedicated GPU, but if you
have an [incompatible GPU](/docs/faq/compatibility/is-my-machine-compatible-with-salad) (such as integrated graphics),
or a very low end GPU model (such as a GT 1030 or GTX 1050), you may see higher earnings when running on your CPU if
it's a mid-range or higher CPU model. Depending on your CPU model, and it's available specifications, you may still be
able to run some other applications, or CPU-light games at the same time as running Salad, due to
[some CPU models not being able to use 100% of your available cores](/docs/faq/compatibility/why-is-salad-not-fully-using-my-cpu).
If you have no compatible GPU installed, you will only be able to run Salad on your CPU. CPU jobs are usually less
frequent than GPU jobs however

## GPU and CPU:

If you have a [compatible GPU and CPU](/docs/faq/compatibility/is-my-machine-compatible-with-salad), enabling Salad for
both can maximize your earnings by allowing Salad to run on both at the same time. When running with both enabled
however, we strongly recommend leaving your PC fully idle, or enabling both only when you intend to go fully AFK from
your PC, as it may become slow to use, even for basic tasks, whilst Chopping. The moment you stop Salad though, or move
your mouse or keyboard [after returning from AFK mode](/docs/guides/using-salad/how-to-enable-auto-start), Salad will
automatically stop and your PC will return to full performance. With both GPU and CPU enabled, we recommend double
checking the power draw, and power consumption, of your PC whilst in this state. As your CPU will usually earn less than
your GPU, you may see a drop in total profit due to the increased power consumption of both devices at the same time if
you have a high-power consumption CPU, or extremely high electricity rates.
