title: How Often do I Earn when Mining with Salad?
---

If you're running Cryptocurrency workloads on Salad, you should see your Salad Balance refreshed every 15 minutes.
However, it's important to note that you may not earn Salad Balance during each interval. Sometimes you might not see
your balance update for up to an hour. But don't worry your average earnings should be close to the expected
daily/hourly crypto earning rate for your GPU.

Crypto mining workloads are available for any
[compatible GPU](/docs/faq/compatibility/is-my-machine-compatible-with-salad), and if there are no
[Containers](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts2CrvnaxvY>) available to chop, Salad will default to these workloads.
