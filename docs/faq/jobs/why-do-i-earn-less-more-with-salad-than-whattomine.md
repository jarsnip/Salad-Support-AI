title: Why Do I Earn Less/More Mining With Salad Than WhatToMine?
---

Mining jobs on Salad typically have lower and more variable earnings compared to Container jobs. This is due to the nature of cryptocurrency mining, which depends heavily on crypto market conditions and luck-based factors.

The 'Earning Rates' given by sites like WhatToMine or Nicehash are guesstimates - anything as inherently random as crypto mining will never yield constant flat rates. Furthermore, their estimates are based on "best possible circumstances," meaning they reflect the _maximum_ that a given GPU _could_ earn under ideal conditions, such as:

- Your GPU performing optimally
- Winning the [Silicon Lottery](<https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/what-is-a-silicon-lottery-and-how-does-affect-mining>)
- Not using the GPU for anything else
- Mining 24 hours/day, 7 days/week
- Achieving [100% luck rates](<https://2miners.com/blog/mining-mining-luck/>)

**Important:** Salad offers workloads beyond just Mining. Container jobs and Bandwidth Sharing typically provide better, more stable earnings than crypto mining. If you're experiencing low earnings with Mining enabled, consider checking your workload preferences to prioritize Container jobs instead.
