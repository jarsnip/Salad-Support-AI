title: Why Is My Earning Rate Sporadic/Random?
---

Salad offers three types of workloads for chefs to share their compute resources and earn rewards: Container workloads,
Bandwidth sharing, and GPU crypto mining. Depending on the quality of your hardware, the needs of the Salad network, and
your internet connection, Chefs may be able to get one or a combination of all three workloads.

---

[Container workloads](/docs/faq/jobs/how-do-i-get-container-jobs) rely on both the hardware you have installed, and
[Demand](<https://salad.com/earn/demand>) from customers. The more powerful your hardware is, and the more jobs are
available, the more Salad Balance and more consistently you will earn. As demand can fluctuate, it's normal to see your
earning rates rise and fall throughout the day or week.

---

[High bandwidth](<https://salad.com/blog/high-bandwidth-jobs/>) jobs require chefs to have super-fast internet connections
and are not available in every region. Demand can also be dependent on the time of day, so you're likely to see higher
earnings during certain portions of the day.

---

Profitability for [mining](/docs/faq/salad-app/what-miners-does-salad-currently-use) workloads depends on the strength
of the crypto markets. These workloads usually run continuously, but the amount earned and the frequency of payouts can
fluctuate based on
[share tracking](<https://medium.com/salad-technologies/the-salad-guide-to-cryptocurrency-share-tracking-ce97763edf6>)
mechanics. Luck plays a role in cryptocurrency mining, resulting in variability in earnings during each payout period.
However, over a longer period, such as a day or a week, earnings should average out if there are no changes in the
crypto markets.

Chefs should ensure that as much of their equipment as possible is enabled to make the most of their idle machine power
and earn rewards, regardless of the combination of workloads they choose to Chop.
