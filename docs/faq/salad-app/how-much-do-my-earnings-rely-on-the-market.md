title: How Much do my Earnings Rely on the Market?
---

Salad's earnings depend on a few factors:

- The availability of [Container Workloads](<https://salad.com/earn/demand>).
- The demand for [Bandwidth](/docs/faq/jobs/what-is-bandwidth-sharing).
- The performance of the [Cryptocurrencies](/docs/faq/salad-app/what-miners-does-salad-currently-use) we mine.

Crypto mining is heavily reliant on the crypto market, whereas our Container workloads and Bandwidth Sharing are
contingent upon the demands of the Salad Network and our SaladCloud clients. We are continuously striving to increase
the demand for our chef's compute resources on the Salad network, but Chefs should not anticipate running containers as
frequently or consistently as traditional crypto mining workloads.
