title: Is Salad Safe for my PC?

## Is Salad Safe to Run?

Salad is safe to run on any well-maintained consumer PC. Graphics Cards (GPUs) and Central Processing Units (CPUs) are
built to run at peak performance and usage for long periods of time. Provided that they're correctly installed and
cooled, they run little risk of degradation or failure.

## Will Salad Damage my PC?

Salad will not impact your hardware any more than playing a video game, hosting your own large language model (LLM) or
running a 3D Blender render would. We're running similar, and sometimes the same, workloads.

We understand if you're still worried, Salad is asking a lot after all. You wouldn't let someone you don't trust borrow
your PC, right? We hope the following information can help reassure you:

- 2,000,000+ unique downloads
- Salad's [Trustpilot score &amp; reviews](<https://www.trustpilot.com/review/salad.com>)
- Over $10,000,000 earned on Salad

Don't want to hear it from us? Feel free to join our [community Discord server](<http://discord.gg/salad>) of over 40,000
fellow Chefs and ask them about their experience with Salad.

## How to Safely Use Your PC's Hardware

- Ensure your GPU and CPU are operating at their factory settings.
- Don't overclock beyond default levels.
- Don't underclock below default levels.
- Keep GPU temperatures under 83ºC (181ºF).

While most GPUs have built-in fail-safes to prevent overheating, altering clock speeds can increase temperatures and
power draw. This will cause instability, lead to lost jobs, and can even cause lasting damage in rare cases.

Additionally, underclocking is against Salad's Terms of Service (ToS), as it can cause job failures and reduce
performance.

## How to Properly Maintain Your PC

- Regularly clean and dust your PC.
- Keep your PC off carpets and away from pets to reduce dust and hair accumulation.

Dust buildup is one of the main causes of overheating. Keep an eye out for dust, dirt, or other grime blocking or
clogging any of your ventilation as well.

## If Salad is Safe, Why Does Antivirus Flag It Sometimes?

Some antivirus programs may flag Salad due to:

- Advanced Windows features we use (like [WSL2](/docs/faq/jobs/what-is-wsl)).
- Additional verified miner software (if you opt in to mining).

This is a common false positive from antivirus software. Rest assured, Salad does not harm your PC or compromise your
privacy. Antivirus tools often use a "zero-trust" approach that can flag safe applications simply for having certain
capabilities.
