## How Much can I Earn with Salad?

The amount of Salad Balance you can Chop using Salad will depend on a few things. Firstly, the hardware you have in your
PC. The more powerful your PC is, the more jobs there are likely to be available. Secondly, how many jobs there are on
the network can fluctuate, so you may see periods with no earnings. Check out our
[Network Monitor](/docs/faq/community/network-monitor) to see current stats, including earning rates. Thirdly, it can
depend on your region. Some workloads are restricted to certain regions like
[Bandwidth Sharing](/docs/faq/jobs/what-is-bandwidth-sharing) or
[Adult Workloads](/docs/guides/getting-jobs/workload-preferences).
