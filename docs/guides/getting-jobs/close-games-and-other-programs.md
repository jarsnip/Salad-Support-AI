title: 'Close Games and Other Programs'

When Chopping with Salad, it's important to ensure that other intensive applications are closed. Salad needs your entire
Graphics Card (GPU), and required Processor (CPU) and Memory (RAM) resources to run Jobs. If you have other programs
running that are using these resources, Salad will automatically
[pause Chopping](/docs/faq/salad-app/temporary-workload-block). This includes:

- Video Games.
- Applications that use GPU Acceleration (e.g. Web Browsers, Discord).
- Video Rendering Software (e.g. Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve).
- 3D Modeling Software (e.g. Blender, Autodesk Maya).
- High Resolution Video Playback (e.g. 4K or 8K video).
- Streaming Applications (e.g. OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS).
- Virtual Machines (e.g. VMware, VirtualBox).
- Other Mining Software (e.g. NiceHash).
- Benchmarking Software (e.g. 3DMark, Unigine Heaven).

To run Salad, close all of these programs before starting. If you need to use these programs after manually starting
Salad, you can pause Salad by selecting the Pause Temporarily or Pause indefinitely option in the Salad App. This will
stop all Jobs from running, and free up your hardware resources. You can then resume Chopping when you're done using
these programs, or automatically when you next go AFK.
