title: 'Configure Auto-Start'
---

For Salad to work most effectively, you need to configure Salad to automatically start Chopping when you go AFK. By
default, it's configured to start Chopping after 10 minutes, but you should adjust this to your PC usage habits.

1. Open the Salad App and navigate to the Settings menu by clicking on your profile icon in the top left corner, and
   then selecting 'Settings'.

2. Scroll down to the 'Idle Chopping' section.
3. Adjust the 'Start After' slider to your preferred time. This is the amount of time your PC needs to be idle before
   Salad starts Chopping.

Idleness is determined by mouse or keyboard activity. You can find a more in-depth guide on
[Auto-Start here](/docs/guides/using-salad/how-to-enable-auto-start).
