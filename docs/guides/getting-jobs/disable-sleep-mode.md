title: 'Disable Sleep Mode'
---

By default, Windows configures your PC to sleep after a short period of inactivity. This will interrupt Salad from
Chopping Salad Balance as programs cannot run while your computer is in Sleep Mode. Disabling sleep mode will ensure
that your computer remains active and able to Chop Salad Balance even when you're not actively using it.

You can disable Sleep Mode from directly within the Salad App. To do this:

1. Open the Salad App and open up settings from your profile icon in the top left corner.
2. From there, scroll down until you see 'Disable Sleep Mode' and toggle it on. This will prevent your computer from
   going to sleep.

If you need more in-depth instructions, you can follow our guide on
[How to Disable Sleep Mode](/docs/guides/using-salad/how-to-disable-sleep-mode).
