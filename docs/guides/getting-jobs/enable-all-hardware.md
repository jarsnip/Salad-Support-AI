To maximize your earnings with Salad, it's important to ensure that all of your hardware is enabled and available for
Chopping. This includes your processor (CPU), Graphics Card (GPU), and Bandwidth.

To enable all of your hardware:

1. Open the Salad App and navigate to the Settings menu by clicking on your profile icon in the top left corner.
2. From there, scroll down to 'Workload Preferences' and ensure that all available options are toggled on under 'Idle
   Chopping'.
3. On the same page, scroll down to Workload Types, and ensure that all available options are toggled on.

You can find an in-depth guide on the settings menu and what each of them do in
[Salad App Settings](/docs/guides/using-salad/salad-app-settings).
