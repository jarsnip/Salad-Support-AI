title: 'Getting Bandwidth Sharing Jobs'
---

Salad offers a variety of job types, including [Bandwidth Sharing Jobs](/docs/faq/jobs/what-is-bandwidth-sharing). These
jobs utilize your idle, spare internet connection bandwidth to Chop Salad Balance. They can run alongside other Jobs and
automatically start whilst Chopping if you're eligible, and it's enabled.

If your country is not currently in this list, you will not be able to receive Bandwidth Sharing Jobs at this time.
Check back regularly though, as we are working to expand to more regions. Bandwidth Sharing is also subject to demand,
and the required bandwidth may increase or decrease throughout the day. You may not see Bandwidth Sharing demand at all
times. Bandwidth Sharing Jobs will not work with a VPN or Proxy enabled.

## **How Fast does my Internet Speed Need to be?**

The minimum internet speed required for Bandwidth Sharing Jobs can vary depending on region, but generally an upload
speed of at least 8 Mbps is required. You can check your internet speed using a service like
[Speedtest](<https://www.speedtest.net/>). If your upload speed is below the minimum requirement, you may not be eligible
for Bandwidth Sharing Jobs. Your download speed should match or exceed your upload speed. More information about minimum
network speeds can be found [here](/docs/faq/compatibility/what-is-the-minimum-recommended-internet-speed-for-salad).
