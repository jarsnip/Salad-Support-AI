title: 'Restarting Salad for New Jobs'
---

We highly discourage restarting Salad in an attempt to get new
[Container Jobs](<https://Community.salad.com/new-feature-container-environments-now-available/>). Doing so can harm your
ability to get Jobs in the future, and it also harms the overall health of the Salad network. Salad will automatically
assign you new, more profitable, Container Jobs if they become available.

By intentionally restarting Salad, you may get yourself temporarily, or even permanently, blocked from receiving that
Job again. If you do this repeatedly, you will likely run out of new Jobs to try, and have no way back to the Jobs you
were previously running. Doing this can also harm the network as a whole. If customers are unable to keep their jobs
running, or find enough machines, they may choose to leave the network entirely. This harms everyone, as it reduces the
overall number of Jobs available for you to run, and the overall earning potential for all Chefs.

## **What Should I do Instead?**

Keep running Salad as normal. If a new, more profitable, Container Job becomes available, Salad will automatically
assign it to you. If you're not making enough to be profitable for you, consider pausing Salad until there is higher
[Demand](/docs/faq/community/network-monitor) for your machine.
