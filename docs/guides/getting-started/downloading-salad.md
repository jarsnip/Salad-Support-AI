The first step in your Salad journey is to download the Salad application. To run Salad, you will need a
[Windows 10 or Windows 11](/docs/faq/compatibility/do-you-support-macos-and-linux) PC. Additional information on the
minimum and recommended system requirements can be found
[here](/docs/faq/compatibility/is-my-machine-compatible-with-salad).

You can download Salad from either our [official website](<https://www.salad.com/download>) or from our official
[GitHub repository](<https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/Salad-Applications/releases>). Click download, and run the
installer once it's ready. It may take a short while if you have a slower internet connection.
