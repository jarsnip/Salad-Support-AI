**Q. Why does my Antivirus block Salad?**

A. Some antivirus programs may flag Salad because we use Advanced Windows features (like
[WSL2](/docs/faq/jobs/what-is-wsl)) and additional verified miner software (if you opt in to mining). This is a common
false positive from antivirus software. Rest assured, Salad does not harm your PC or compromise your privacy. Antivirus
tools often use a "zero-trust" approach that can flag safe applications simply for having certain capabilities. You will
need to whitelist Salad by following our collection of guides available here:
[How to whitelist Salad](/docs/troubleshooting/antivirus/)
