title: How Estimated Earnings Work

## **How are my Estimated Earnings Calculated?**

While Chopping, Salad will automatically calculate Estimated Earnings for the amount of Salad Balance you would earn for
24 hours if you keep your current jobs.

We calculate the earnings by taking the amount you earned over the last 5 minutes and multiplying it out to 24 hours.
Due to the variability of jobs it is expected to see this number go up and down over the course of the day. It is
advised to monitor earnings via the [Earning History](/docs/guides/using-salad/how-to-see-your-earnings-history) on the
Salad web app. This will give you a more accurate view of your earnings over time.

Your Estimated Earnings figure is for your local machine only. If you have multiple machines connected to your Salad
account, they'll provide independent Predicted Earnings. Your earnings are combined across all connected machines.

## **Why did I earn a different amount than what it Estimated?**

When Chopping is enabled, that indicates to Salad that your machine is _available_ for jobs. If there are
[no jobs available for your machine](/docs/faq/salad-app/how-does-my-machine-earn-salad-balance), or you have disabled
jobs like mining, Chefs should not expect to see Estimated Earnings until a job becomes available for their PC.

Your Estimated Earnings value is calculated using dynamic profitability and job data. As this value changes all
throughout the day, it's likely that you may see a different value showing for your Estimated Earnings, versus your Last
24 Hours at any given moment. Job earnings can be extremely variable and are calculated based on the time a job is
working on your machine.
