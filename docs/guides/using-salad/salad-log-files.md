## Understanding your log files:

## \\

The logs in the root of the Logs folder are the main SaladBowl logs. We persist these logs for 7 days. We may request
these logs if you are experiencing a generic issue with the widget, or issues running the right jobs on your machine.

## \\gpuz

These log files track and record sensor data we receive in order to show GPU temperatures and usage in the widget. We
persist these logs for 1 day. We may request these logs if you are not seeing your GPU usage or temperature within the
widget.

## \\gpuz-init

These are the initialization logs for the above service, which logs what GPUs are installed in your machine, and
information about your GPUs. We persist these logs for 1 day. We may request these logs if your GPU(s) is not appearing
within the widget.

## \\systeminformation

These are the initialization logs to gather other system information like CPU model, and available system RAM. We
persist these logs for 1 day. We may request these logs if your CPU(s) is not appearing within the widget.

## \\\[job name]

Logs found in other folder names (such as T-rex, TeamRedMiner, XMRig) contain the miner logs. We persist these logs for
7 days. We may request these logs if you are having issues running jobs on your machine.
