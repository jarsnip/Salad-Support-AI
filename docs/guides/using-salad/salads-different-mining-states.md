Salad has 5 available "Running" states. These are:

- Chop Now
  - Clicking Chop Now will manually start Salad until you stop it, or
    [open a game](/docs/faq/salad-app/temporary-workload-block).

- Pause Until Idle
  - Selecting this option will pause Salad, until you go idle on your PC. After that, Salad will start automatically
    based on your [defined auto-start time](/docs/guides/using-salad/salad-app-settings).

- Pause Until A Set Time
  - This option will allow you to pause Salad until a defined time. After that, Salad will automatically start.

- Pause Indefinitely
  - Selecting this option will pause Salad until you manually start it again. Auto start will not kick in when you go
    idle.
