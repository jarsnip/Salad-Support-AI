title: How to Check if your Salad Installer is Safe
---

It's important to make sure you've downloaded Salad from the right source, and that you have your hands on a legitimate
bit of Salad Chopping software. Using third party builds of Salad, or downloading Salad from non-official sources, could
result in your earnings being skimmed by bad actors, your account being breached, or possibly worse.

You can verify if the version of Salad you downloaded is legit by following this guide here:

1. Open up Windows Powershell.

2. Navigate into the folder where your installer was downloaded. By default this is Downloads. You can do this by
   entering `cd Downloads` and hitting enter.

3. Once you're here, run the `Get-FileHash /file-name.exe | Format-List` command. For example:
   `Get-FileHash Salad-1.8.6.exe | Format-List`. This will return the Hash for the selected file.

4. Then, compare the Hash to our [Github Release](<https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/Salad-Applications/releases>) page
   to check if your installer, or main salad.exe application is legit. If it doesn't match you should immediately remove
   it from your system, and run an Antivirus scan if installed.
