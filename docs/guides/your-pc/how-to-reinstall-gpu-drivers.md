title: How to Reinstall your GPU Drivers.
---

If you're experiencing problems with your Graphics Card (GPU) whilst running Salad, you may need to reinstall your GPU
drivers. Your GPU drivers are the software that allows your operating system to communicate with your GPU. Sometimes
they can become corrupted or outdated, leading to issues with performance or stability.

## How to Uninstall your GPU Drivers

First, we need to uninstall your current GPU drivers. This is best done using a tool called 'Display Driver Uninstaller'
(DDU). DDU is a free Windows utility that will remove your GPU drivers, allowing you to start fresh with the latest
version.

1. Download DDU. This tool is safe to download and use, and has been a trusted utility by the PC community for many
   years. You can download DDU [here](<https://www.guru3d.com/download/display-driver-uninstaller-download>).
2. Install DDU. To install, simply run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Open DDU. Once installed, open the DDU application.
4. Once opened, You'll need to select 'GPU' from the drop-down menu on the right side of the app. This will ensure that
   DDU is set to remove GPU drivers.
5. Select the "Clean and Restart" option on the left. This will remove your GPU drivers and restart your PC.

Once your PC has restarted, your GPU drivers will be uninstalled, and you can proceed to reinstall them. Don't worry if
your screen looks blurry or large, or if only one of your screens turns on. This is normal as you currently have no
drivers installed.

You can find additional documentation for DDU on their
