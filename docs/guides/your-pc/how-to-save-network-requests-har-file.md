title: How to Save Network Requests (HAR File)
---

You may get prompted by our support agents to send a HAR file in order to help identify and fix your issue.

Most browser Developer Tools have the ability to record network requests made in the browser as well as export them to a
HAR file. Let's go over the steps required to do so.

---

**Follow these steps:**

1. Once in your browser, open developers tools (press F12, or Control + Shift + I).
2. Go to the `Network` tab.
3. Prepare yourself to reproduce the issue, head over to the correct page and pre-enter any data required or click
   buttons prior to the issue taking place.
4. Press the small clear log icon, second button in the toolbar.
5. Make sure the `Preserve Logs` option is checked.
6. Reproduce the issue. The network tab should fill with requests.
7. Export the HAR file by pressing the download button in the toolbar, make sure to use a location you will remember, as
   you'll need the file later.
8. Send the file in your next Support Ticket.
