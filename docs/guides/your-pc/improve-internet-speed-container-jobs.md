title: How to Improve Internet Speed for Container Jobs
---

Container Jobs require a minimum amount of bandwidth to run properly, and the better your internet speed, the more jobs
your machine may qualify for. Here's our recommendations for improving your internet speed.

## Use a Wired Connection

- A direct Ethernet cable connection is faster and more reliable than Wi-Fi.
- Avoid interference from other devices and walls that weaken Wi-Fi signals.

## Close Bandwidth-Heavy Applications

- Stop downloads, streaming (Netflix, YouTube, Twitch), and large file uploads.
- Pause cloud backups (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox) while running workloads.

## Limit Other Devices on Your Network

- Disconnect unused phones, tablets, and smart home devices.
- If possible, ask others on your network to avoid gaming or streaming while you run Container Jobs.

## Optimize Your Router Setup

- Place your router in an open, central location for better signal.
- Restart your router occasionally to clear congestion.
- Use the 5GHz or 6GHz Wi-Fi band if available for faster speeds.

## Check Your Internet Plan

- Check your ISP plan to ensure you meet minimum speed requirements.

## Run a Speed Test

- Use Speedtest.net or a similar tool to check your download, upload, and latency.
- If your speeds don't match your ISP's advertised rate, contact them for troubleshooting.
