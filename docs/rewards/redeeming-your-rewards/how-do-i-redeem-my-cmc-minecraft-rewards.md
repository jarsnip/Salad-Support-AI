title: How Do I Redeem My CMC Minecraft Rewards?
---

Redeeming keys (aka coupons) is actually quite simple. CMC reward keys are redeemed on CMC's website.

## CMC Cosmetic Redemption

1. If you do not have a CMClient account, go to
   [https://cm-pack.pl/panel/sign-up.php](<https://cm-pack.pl/panel/sign-up.php>) and create an account with the same
   nickname you use in Minecraft.
2. If you already have an account, go to the login page on
   [https://cm-pack.pl/panel/sign-in.php](<https://cm-pack.pl/panel/sign-in.php>) and log in using your email or nickname
   and password.
3. Go to the "Activate Code" page [https://cm-pack.pl/panel/activate.php](<https://cm-pack.pl/panel/activate.php>) enter
   the key you received from Salad in the field "Activation Code" and click "Activate".
4. Add the cosmetic to your nickname on the "Cosmetics" page
   [https://cm-pack.pl/panel/cosmetic](<https://cm-pack.pl/panel/cosmetics.php>).
