title: How Do I Redeem My Riot Games Rewards?
---

Redeeming keys (aka coupons) is actually quite simple. Valorant or League of Legends gift cards are redeemed in-game and
can then be used to buy weapons, skins, and emotes from either game's shop.

## League of Legends Gift Card Redemption

1. Start up the League of Legends client, or create an account at
   [signup.leagueoflegends.com](<https://signup.leagueoflegends.com/>).
2. Once you've logged in to the League of Legends client, click on the "Purchase RP" button near the top right.
3. Select "Prepaid Cards" and enter the code you received from Salad.
4. Click submit.

## Valorant Gift Card Redemption

1. Start up Valorant.
2. In the top right corner of the main menu, you will see two currencies: Valorant Points and Radianite Points. "Click"
   the circle for Valorant Points (the top circle).
3. On the next screen, navigate to the far right tab that says "Prepaid Cards &amp; Codes".
4. Paste or type in the coupon code you received from Salad and click "Submit".

## Experiencing Issues with Your Reward?

If you are experiencing issues activating or using your reward (such as having trouble entering your key, or an issue
with the services not outlined in the above guide), you can contact Riot Games directly for assistance on their
[official support page for Valorant](<https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us>) or
