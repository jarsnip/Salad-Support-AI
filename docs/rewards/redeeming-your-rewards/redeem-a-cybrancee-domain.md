## **How Do I Redeem Cybrancee Rewards?**

Once you have purchased a Cybrancee voucher from the Salad Storefront, you'll receive an activation code that can be
redeemed for a Cybrancee service plan.
([How do I find my activation code?](/docs/guides/using-salad/where-to-find-your-reward-redemption-code))

If you need help beyond what is supplied in this guide page, please refer to Cybrancee's official help center,
[here](<https://cybrancee.com/learn/>).

_Please note: In order to manage your Cybrancee service plan, you will need to create a free account at_
[_cybrancee.com_](<https://cybrancee.com/>)_. Because new account creations are subject to a manual review period, your
subscription will activate once the Cybrancee team has approved your request._
