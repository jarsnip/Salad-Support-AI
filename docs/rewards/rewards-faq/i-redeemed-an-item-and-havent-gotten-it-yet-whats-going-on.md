title: I Redeemed an item and Haven't Gotten it Yet. What's Going On?
---

Most store redemptions are automatic and usually immediate, however some are issued through third party systems and can
take a few hours. If you haven't received your reward yet, you can check the status of your redemption in your
[Reward Vault](/docs/guides/using-salad/where-to-find-your-reward-redemption-code). In here you can find the status of
each of your redemptions, as well as the key, and some other information about your purchase. Some rewards are delivered
directly to your email inbox, and can't be found in the
[Reward Vault](/docs/guides/using-salad/where-to-find-your-reward-redemption-code).

If your reward is still 'Pending', you just need to sit tight and we will get it to you as soon as possible. If
something goes wrong, we will let you know with the 'Canceled' status. If your purchase has failed there could be a few
reasons behind this.

- The store, or supplier, we obtain this item from may be down, or having issues that prevented your purchase.
- Your key may have gotten lost on the way to us, or something else may have gone wrong obtaining it.
- We may have run out of stock.
- If you selected a PayPal reward, make sure to check your email for instructions to claim it.

If your purchase should fail, you will get automatically refunded the full amount, allowing you to try purchasing the
item again, or to purchase something else if. If you don't see your refund, make sure to refresh the application. If you
never receive your refund, you can contact [Salad Support](/contact) and we can help you get your Salad Balance back.
