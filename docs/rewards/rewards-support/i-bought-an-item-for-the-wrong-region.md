title: I Bought an Item for the Wrong Region
---

If you have bought an item for the wrong region, unfortunately we won't be able to provide a refund. We run a
[No Refund policy](/docs/rewards/rewards-support/i-want-a-refund), which means you will not be able to refund, or
exchange your reward with us once it's been purchased.

We recommend double checking [what region your reward is for](/docs/rewards/rewards-faq/what-region-is-this-reward-for)
before purchasing it, this should be stated in the product's name or description. We cannot guarantee that rewards will
work outside of the explicitly stated regions, this means that for example:

- Countries outside of the official EU listing in Europe may not be able to use EU keys.
- Countries outside of North America may not be able to use NA keys.

## What Should I Do?

Someone else might want what you bought. We recommend trying to swap or exchange your reward with someone else, but keep
an eye out for scams.
