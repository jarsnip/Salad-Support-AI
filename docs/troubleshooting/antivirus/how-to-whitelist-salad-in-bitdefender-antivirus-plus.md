**6. Adding Salad as an Exception**

After you have clicked "Add an Exception" you will be shown a dialogue box. In that dialogue box you'll want to navigate
to the Salad Miners folder and select it, the filepath for this is "C:\\ProgramData\\Salad\\workloads" (without the
quotations). Make sure to enable Antivirus protection for all 3 settings, as well as Online Threat Prevention.

**10. Run Salad to download the miners**

Start Salad, and wait for it to reach the Chopping state. Once the Chopping state is reached, you can stop Salad.

setting, allowing it to continue protecting you.
