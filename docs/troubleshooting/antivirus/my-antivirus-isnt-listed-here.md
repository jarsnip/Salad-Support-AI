title: My Antivirus isn't Listed Here
---

We have in-depth guides available for many common Antivirus options. If there isn't a guide for you, you can still
follow the official whitelist guide from your Antivirus manufacturer. When you get to adding an exclusion, you'll need
to add this path: `C:\ProgramData\Salad\workloads`.

If your Antivirus isn't listed above, we can still help. Whilst we can't provide an in-depth guide, you can follow these
basic steps below that should still apply to your Antivirus.

## Whitelisting Salad's Miners

If Salad is being blocked by your Antivirus, you'll need to add a whitelist. The folder you need to whitelist is
`C:\ProgramData\Salad\workloads` . If your Antivirus service does not support folder whitelists, you will need to add a
whitelist for the individual [miner](/docs/faq/salad-app/what-miners-does-salad-currently-use) `.exe` files. These can
be found under `C:\ProgramData\Salad\workloads` . In this directory, you can find all of the folders for the miner
plugins we use, you'll need to whitelist each of the files within these folders.

## Disabling Web-Shields

Your Antivirus may have a built-in web-shield or firewall service, if Salad is still being blocked after whitelisting
the above path, you may need to disable this feature from your Antivirus, or add a whitelist for the miners.
