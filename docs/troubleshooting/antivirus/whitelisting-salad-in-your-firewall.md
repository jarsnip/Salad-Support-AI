title: Whitelisting Salad in your Firewall
---

If you have a third party firewall installed on your system, network or router, you may need to add a whitelist if you
are having troubles connecting to the Salad pools. Due to the large number of possible firewall services and
configurations, we may not be able to provide a guide specific for your service. If we don't have one for you, we have
provided the required addresses to whitelist:

- prohashing.com
- nicehash.com
- 104.21.61.81
- 172.65.223.147
- 172.65.200.133
- 104.17.254.46
- 178.128.242.134
- 199.247.27.41

These addresses all correspond to pools and connections used by Salad to earn you balance. Don't worry, they're safe to
whitelist, and you'll stay safe and secure.
