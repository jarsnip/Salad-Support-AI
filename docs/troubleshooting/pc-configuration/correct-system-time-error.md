title: Correct System Time Error
---

Some Chefs may experience issues with Salad workloads if their PC clock is set to the wrong time. Chefs should confirm
that their PC is set to automatically update the time and date. If that does not resolve the issue, check that your PC
is synchronized properly to your internet time server.

## Set Time Automatically in Windows

1. Right click on the date/time widget in your PCs taskbar and select **_Adjust date and time_**.

3. If your PC time has not been synchronized lately, you may need to change the internet time server your PC is
   attempting to sync to. Choose one of the time servers available, and hit **Update Now**.
