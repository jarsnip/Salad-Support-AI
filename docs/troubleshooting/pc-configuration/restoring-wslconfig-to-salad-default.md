title: Restoring .WSLConfig to Salad Default
---

Salad uses the `.WSLConfig` file to configure the container environment values and defaults. Within that file, Salad
also sets the amount of RAM that can be used for the container. This file is usually auto-generated by Windows when you
install [WSL](/docs/faq/jobs/what-is-wsl).

---

If your Salad shows an incomplete Chopping Power bar because of this, please follow the directions below to fix this
issue.

## Using the WSL Settings Window

If you are using a WSL version that is recent (&gt;= 2.3.24), you may have access to a special configuration Window to
manage your WSL installation.

1. In the Windows Search Bar, look for "WSL Settings", and launch it

   ![Screenshot of Windows Search looking for WSL Settings](../../../../content/images/troubleshooting/pc-configuration/restoring-wslconfig-to-salad-default-2.png)

   WSL Settings App Search

2. Once open, do not modify any configuration settings except for the one under "Memory Size".
3. Click on "Memory Size", which should show a dropdown menu (Your actual values may vary):

   WSL Settings - Editing RAM

4. Update the value in the field according to this information:
   1. Systems under _16GB_ of RAM, **leave the file as-is.**
   2. Systems with _16GB to 23GB_ of RAM, set it to **14500**
   3. Systems with _24GB to 31GB_ of RAM, set it to **16500**
   4. Systems with _32GB to 63GB_ of RAM, set it to **24700**
   5. Systems with _64GB to 91GB_ of RAM, set it to **32900**
   6. Systems with _92GB to 131GB_ of RAM, set it to **65700**
   7. Systems where RAM is at or above 132GB, set it to **50% of your system RAM**
   8. **Note:** do not forget to add the "MB" at the end of the line. For example:
      1. On a System with 196GB RAM , set to **98000MB** (196/2 = 98GB, so 98000MB)

5. Once the information is entered, press Enter on your Keyboard, and click back on the dropdown to update the value
   (you should see the new value being set automatically).
6. Reboot your system to apply the changes

## Updating it Manually

If you prefer to do it manually, a file named `.wslconfig` may also already exist on your machine which stores these
types of settings.

1. To find it, open the File Explorer, and click on the top explorer bar:

   .wslconfig is stored.
   1. **Note:** If you have not activated "Hidden Items" view, you may need to enable it like so:
