## How do I Fix it?

Try clearing some email from your email inbox, if it's full you won't be able to receive your one-time login code.

If your inbox is not full, then it is likely due to user permissions. This happens when you have marked an email as
spam, or told our mailing server to not send you any emails from the address. You may have accidentally done this on
another email from us via the same address. In order to regain access to your account, you will need to re opt-in to
receiving emails. You can do so by following these steps:

1. Open a [new ticket](/contact)
2. Inform us in your ticket that you are unable to access your account and need to opt-in to receiving emails
3. Provide the email address of your account in your ticket, the email address you provide **MUST** match the email
   address you are contacting us from
4. Wait for a "ticket received" email from us
5. Reply to the email from the same address you provided, and give explicit permission to opt-in to receiving emails
6. Wait for a confirmation email from us letting you know your account is able to be accessed
7. Log into your account
