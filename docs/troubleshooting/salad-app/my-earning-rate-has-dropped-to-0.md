title: My Earning Rate has Dropped to 0
---

You may see intermittent drop-outs in earnings. This is expected on Salad as job availability varies. For example, you
might see higher earning rates one day when certain Container jobs are in demand, and see lower earning rates a few days
later when those jobs are no longer needed. You are not guaranteed to get a CPU or GPU Container 24/7. That said, there
are some things you can do to increase your odds:

1. **Check your workload preferences**: If you have Mining enabled, it may cause lower earnings compared to Container jobs.
   Container workloads typically offer better earning rates. Review your workload preferences in the Salad app settings.
2. Give it some time! For Container workloads, our most reliable chefs with the best hardware will get priority on the
   network. So make sure you are ready and able to chop Containers when they are available.
3. It's possible there aren't currently any jobs available for your hardware, or other Chefs are already Chopping all
   the jobs. Check out our [Network Monitor](<https://salad.com/earn/demand>) to see how much demand your hardware has and
   then leave your Salad App Chopping to stay in the queue.
4. Salad runs best when it's the only program using your GPU.  If you're gaming or using software that requires hardware
   acceleration your earning rates will be negatively affected or may even prevent you from running jobs at all.
   Reminder: Salad is best used when AFK!

## Still Nothing?

If none of the above works and you never get an earning rate, consider these:

1. Make sure Salad is not being blocked by your antivirus or firewall. You can follow our guide to solve this
   [here](/docs/troubleshooting/antivirus):
2. If you're on a laptop, make sure you're plugged into power.
3. Well, sometimes it's just not meant to be.  We can't offer any money for lost earning time, so if you're
   uncomfortable with this then please don't use Salad.
