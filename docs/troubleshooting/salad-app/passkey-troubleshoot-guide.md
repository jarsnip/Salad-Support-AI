title: Passkey Troubleshooting
---

Some Chefs may have issues while trying to set up or use Salad Passkeys. This is generally caused by a misconfiguration
in the passkey manager that is being used.

On Windows Systems, the underlying system that should handle your passkeys is Windows Hello. It is a base feature that
is included in both Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems. However, you may have to set it up and configure it so
that it works on your machine.

Chefs should follow the following Windows Guide to configure Windows Hello, by choosing the most convenient option
available to them - Fingerprint, Facial Recognition, or PIN:
